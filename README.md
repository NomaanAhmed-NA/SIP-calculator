# SIP-calculator
The SIP calculator project uses Python to determine the estimated maturity value and wealth gain of a Systematic Investment Plan. It takes the monthly investment amount, expected annual return, and tenure from the user and applies the Future Value of an Annuity formula to project the final investment corpus.
